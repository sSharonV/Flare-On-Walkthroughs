## Introduction

This walkthrough focuses on analyzing the `home.html` file to uncover a hidden script embedded as a PNG file using PHP. The PHP code within the PNG is then processed to reveal a JavaScript snippet. We'll use tools like a hex editor and Python scripts to decode and understand these hidden components.

## Step 1: Inspect `home.html` with a Browser's Developer Tools

1. Open `home.html` in a browser with developer tools enabled.
2. Locate the PHP include statement embedded between `<script>` tags in the HTML source:
   ```html
   </script>
   ** <?php include "img/flare-on.png" ?> **
   <script type="text/javascript">
   ```
   - This is an unconventional way of embedding a PNG file as PHP code, which is suspicious and may indicate hidden content or a payload.

## Step 2: Examine `flare-on.png` for Embedded PHP Code

1. Open `flare-on.png` in a hex editor and navigate to offset `19c4` to locate any embedded PHP code.
2. Extract the PHP code from the PNG and save it as `1_php.php`.
3. Convert the extracted PHP code into a Python format and save it as `1_php.py` for further analysis.

## Step 3: Analyze the Initial `do_me` Statement and Extract JavaScript

1. Run the Python script `1_php.py` to print the first `do_me` statement that would be executed.
2. Save the next JavaScript code block that is printed by `1_php.py` as `2_js.py` for further investigation.
3. Use `2_decode.py` to deobfuscate the JavaScript code, revealing the true content.
4. After deobfuscation, the following PHP code snippet is exposed:
   ```php
   base64_decode(
       $code=base64_decode(if(isset($_POST["a11DOTthatDOTjava5crapATflareDASHonDOTcom"])); });
   eval($code);
   ```
