# Flare-On 2014 Challenge 3 Walkthrough: Packed Executable with Shellcode

This walkthrough details the process of analyzing a **packed executable** containing **shellcode**. The goal is to unpack the executable, understand the shellcode's construction, and extract the hidden **FLAG**. Tools such as **DIE**, **IDA Pro**, and dynamic debugging techniques are utilized throughout the process.

## Introduction

In this challenge, we are tasked with unpacking a **packed executable** that contains **shellcode**. The shellcode is decoded in stages through a series of XOR operations, and the objective is to ultimately extract the hidden **FLAG**. We will utilize both **static analysis** tools such as **DIE** and **IDA Pro**, along with **dynamic debugging** techniques to dissect the shellcode and understand its XOR key manipulations.

---

## Step 1: Initial Analysis with DIE

- We begin the analysis by inspecting the file with **DIE**, which indicates that the file is an **executable**. 
  ![DIE Output](images/0-die-output.png)
- Upon executing the file, we encounter a **Fatal application exit error**. This error likely suggests an issue with the fileâ€™s structure, potentially related to a **corrupted byte** or packing.

  - This behavior may indicate a handled exception within the application rather than a genuine error message.

---

## Step 2: Handling the Packed Executable

- Next, we open the file in **IDA Pro** for static analysis. Upon loading, IDA displays an error indicating that the file is packed, likely due to a **corrupted import segment**.

## Step 3: Identifying Shellcode Construction

1. To proceed with the static analysis, we focus on the error triggered when executing `sub_401000`.

    - This occurs when attempting to execute the instruction referencing `0x0019FD33`, which is supposed to jump to the shellcode.

2. Note the call eax which is probably the call to the shellcode in the memory. 
    - We can see it's starting instructions:

**At this point, we begin tracking how the memory is populated with the shellcode at various stages.**

---

## Step 4: Stage 1 - `and so it be`

- To gain a better understanding of the shellcode construction, we use **dynamic debugging** and set breakpoints at key locations in the shellcode.

1. The first block of code performs an XOR operation on the shellcode content with the value `66h`.

  ![After Xored](images/4-After-writing-Xored.png)

2. After executing this block, we observe the following in memory:
    - The first string `and so it be`.

## Step 5: Stage 2 - `get ready to get nop'ed so damn hard in the paint`

- The analysis continues as the next stage performs an XOR operation on the content of ESI with a password pushed onto the stack:
    
  ![Push `nopassaurus`](images/6-pushed-password.png)

- This results in the XOR operation using this password as a key.
   ![Stage 2](images/7-Xor-key.png)

- After executing this part of the shellcode, the next stage is successfully decoded:

---

## Step 6: Stage 3 - `omg is it almost over?!?`

- In the next stage, another XOR operation occurs, followed by several NOP operations. A string is pushed onto the stack:

    ![Nops](images/10-Damn-nop-ed.png)
    ![Pushes in Stack](images/10-pushed-string.png)
    
    - This string is then used as a key in a subsequent XOR operation:
    ![Xor with key](images/10-used-key-in-xor.png)

- After executing this section, we see the following in memory:
    ![Flag in memory](images/13-FLAG.png)

## Step 7: The FLAG

- The final XOR operation reveals the **FLAG**:
