## Flare-On 2014

- **Challenge 1**: [Decoding `dat_secret`](https://github.com/sSharonV/Flare-On-Walkthroughs/blob/main/2014/CH_1)  
  - Decode a hidden secret from the binary by utilizing tools like DnSpy to decode and reveal the secret.
  
- **Challenge 2**: [**`home.html`** Analysis](https://github.com/sSharonV/Flare-On-Walkthroughs/blob/main/2014/CH_2)  
  - Extract and decode a hidden PHP-encoded script embedded in a PNG image.

- **Challenge 3**: [Packed Executable with Shellcode](https://github.com/sSharonV/Flare-On-Walkthroughs/tree/main/2014/CH_3)

  - Analyzing a packed executable with shellcode by employing dynamic debugging techniques to progressively decode the shellcode in memory.

- **Challenge 4**: [Hidden Shellcode in Obfuscated JavaScript and PDF Document](https://github.com/sSharonV/Flare-On-Walkthroughs/tree/main/2014/CH_4)

  - Analyze a PDF file containing obfuscated JavaScript and uncover the hidden shellcode within it.
 
- **Challenge 5**: [Reverse Engineering Keylogger DLL](https://github.com/sSharonV/Flare-On-Walkthroughs/tree/main/2014/CH_5)

  - Performed static analysis of a keylogger DLL to decode the required key sequence.
  - Developed an IDAPython script that serves as a solid reference for implementing complex functionality within the IDAPython framework, showcasing essential automation techniques for IDA Pro analysis.
 
- **Challenge 6**: [Reverse Engineering an ELF Binary with Shellcode](https://github.com/sSharonV/Flare-On-Walkthroughs/tree/main/2014/CH_6)

  - In-depth reverse engineering of an ELF binary, analyzing anti-debugging techniques, uncovering and decoding embedded shellcode, and extracting the hidden flag using dynamic and static analysis methods.
  - Implements remote-linux debugging and practical usage of strace as part of the dynamic debugging process to investigate system calls and bypass challenges during runtime.
 
- **Challenge 7**: [Decoding Obfuscated Executable by Brute Forcing]([TBD](https://github.com/sSharonV/Flare-On-Walkthroughs/tree/main/2014/CH_7)
  - Comprehensive reverse engineering of anti-debugging techniques used by an executable, including VMware detection and dynamic anti-debugging measures.
